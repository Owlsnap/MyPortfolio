About Me
Hi! I'm Alex, a passionate web developer with a knack for crafting captivating digital experiences. With a specialization in React and a special affection for CSS wizardry and unique design, I thrive on turning ideas into visually stunning and highly functional websites and web applications.

Beyond my love for coding, I bring a diverse background that adds depth to my work. I'm not just your average developer; I'm also deeply passionate about fitness. In fact, before diving into the world of web development, I spent years as a health coach, trainer, and bodybuilder. This unique blend of experiences fuels my creativity and problem-solving skills, allowing me to approach challenges with a tough mentality and deliver solutions that exceed expectations.

My toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. Whether it's bringing a client's vision to life or brainstorming innovative solutions to problems, I'm always up for the challenge.

Let's connect and create something extraordinary together!
